When these issues overlap, the danger rises far more than when they occur alone. Despite low awareness, people are eager to learn how CKM is diagnosed and treated.

In a clinical trial, arginine-treated dental plaque stayed less acidic, became structurally less harmful, and supported more beneficial bacteria. These changes made the biofilms less aggressive after sugar exposure. The results point to arginine as a promising, natural addition to cavity-prevention ... \nRELATED TOPICS"

Many of these hidden emissions can transform into fine particles that are dangerous to breathe. The study shows wildfire pollution rivals human-made emissions in some parts of the world. This helps explain why wildfire smoke can linger and worsen air quality long after the flames are ... \nRELATED TOPICS"
